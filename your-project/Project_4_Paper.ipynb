In this project, I want to analyse my carbon footprint, which is the total amount of CO<sub>2</sub> produced by an individual during his activities, during the last two months. Besides, I also want to compare the difference of carbon footprint between using my car and take the public transportation."

    "The data I used is downloaded from the google map my timeline, where it registered my locations, activities and movements from 2016. The data provided by google is in json type, which means that the data is a nested, nested, nested*n format. In each item of json (see 1.2.1 section of the Project_4_main.ipynb), google provides the timestamp, coordinate, altitude, accuracy, heading, velocity and the activity. Inside the activity item, there are several nested data showing different activities that google assume you are doing with different confidence, ordered by the confidence degree. For the purpose of this project, I only want to look at the data from May 2019, when I started to commute to Barcelona by car instead by train (see 1.2.3 section of the Project_4_main.ipynb).  \n",

The next challenge is that, google registered my activity almost every 2 minutes, I have too much data with the same activity but different timestamp. To overcome this problem, I created two columns to indicate the departure and arrival timestamps and only used this timestamps to calculate the commute time (1.2.8 section of the main.ipynb)\n",
