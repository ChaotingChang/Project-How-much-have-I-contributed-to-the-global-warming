## Project Description
In this project I want to know my carbon footprint (how much carbon I have produced) during the last 2 months by driving to Barcelona instead of using public transportation. 


<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Questions (Things I want to know)  

 - How long is my commute time (from Sabadell to Barcelona Glories) ? 
 - Does it differ before and after July (when people are in vacation)?
 - Does the commute time differ by rain event?
 - How much carbon I have emitted during the last two months by car?
 - How much carbon I would emitted if I use the public transporation.

## Dataset
The data is downloaded from the Google My Timeline and the carbon emission information is from [UK Vehicle Certification Agency]( https://carfueldata.vehicle-certification-agency.gov.uk/) and [Carbon Footprint 
of Railway Infrastructure](https://uic.org/IMG/pdf/carbon_footprint_of_railway_infrastructure.pdf)
